## Main Issues

- [ ] Finding good google maps like library.
> But not quite like google maps, as we don't need long/lat.
> Need ideas on how to slice input images into tiles. Though do we need tiles?
- [ ] Find way of transitioning between layers on front end.
- [ ] Nice way to add points of interest.
- [ ] Move to now/github pages hosts site, with a GCP or hosted SQL backend to save costs/maintenance.
